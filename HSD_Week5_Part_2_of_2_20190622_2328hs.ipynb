    "The outcome of this work is oriented to ***help stakeholders interested in opening a Peruvian Restaurant in Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Buenos Aires is a top tourist destination in Latin America, is known for its preserved eclectic european architecture and rich cultural life. Since it is a multicultural city, being home to multiple ethnic and religious groups, there are many restaurants, for that reason, looking for an adequate place to open a new one is an important challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the ***main drivers for decision making*** are related with the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- places not currently crowded with restaurants\n",
    "- places in areas with group of ethnic restaurants (non of them with peruvian cousine)\n",
    "- places thar are as close to city downtown\n",
    "\n",
    "***Data Science*** methods, processes and tools will be applied in order to help identifying city areas candidates based on the aforesaid criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of questions that this work may help to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this a good place to open a restaurant?\n",
    "Is it a promissing place that will allow the Business to have good financial performance?\n",
    "Will it be a place that will help the Business to be expanded to other city areas in the future?"

    "\n",
    "a) Understanding of the Business context:\n",
    "- Basic konowledge fo Ciudad de Buenos Aires Geography and neighborhood: to proced with thi steps, GEO information gathered from Goverment is used. JSON files from goverment site was used to have a produce a map of the city and its 15 neighboorhoods or \"Comunas\"\n",
    "- Data visualization of neighbohoods: in order to undertand the \"big picture\" folium graphs were created \n",
    "- Project oObjective reconfirmation was done with stakeholders, and as an outcome, 1 og the neighborhoods were set as teh targeted area (CABALLITO) due to its central position in Ciudad de Buenos Aires, and the particular interest in developing the business there \n",
    "\n",
    "b) Collecting all the necessary data for the analysis:\n",
    "- location and type (category) of every restaurant in the nearby area of interest (Ciudad de Buenos Aires): Tools used FourSquare API, Geo libraries  \n",
    "- reconfirming  central point of interest for the analysis: Tools used: wikipedia sites, and  GEO JSON file\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Data exploration, data wrangling/enrichment and data modeling\n",
    "- identification of venues in the nearby of the area of analysis (CABALLITO): use of data modeling techniques to breakdown CABALLITO area into sub-areas (matrix area view with centroids equally placed)\n",
    "- isolation of the correct venues: filtering data in order to have only restaurant sites, and discard references to oher places such as coffee, spa, and so on.\n",
    "- data modeling an enrichment of data in order to simplify multiple restaurant types (19) into 3 new created types: Local (argentinean restaurants),  fast foods, and Ethnical restaurants (where the Peruvian restaurant are included)\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Inferential and statistical testing\n",
    "- review statistics on restaurants in the target area to do drill down; top down / bottom up analysis comparing local argentinean restaurants an non argentinean restaurants (Mediterranean, Korean, Japanese, Italian, Peruvian, and so on)\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Knowledge Discovery for making recommendation using Machine learning techniques\n",
    "- use of k-means clustering in order to identify adequate areas within CABALLITO Comuna for putting a new Peruvian Restaurant. This is to plot at geographical level neighborhood / street the suitable place for starting the new business"
